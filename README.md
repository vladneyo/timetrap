## Description

`timetrap` library is intended to wrap your code and measure the time of its execution.

### Install it as:

```
cargo install timetrap
```

### Time

#### Example of use:

```
use timetrap::*;

trap!("section A", {
     let a = 0;
     ...
});
```

which results in:

```
section A took 14.834Âµs
```

### Memeory

Also with help of [sysinfo](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/sysinfo) you can measure memory usage in the same manner.

#### Example of use:

```
use timetrap::*;

trap_mem!("make_plot()", MemUnits.Kb, {
     let a = 0;
     ...
});
```

which results in:

```
make_plot() took 928.328083ms
make_plot() consumed memory: 560.00Kb
make_plot() consumed swap: 0.00Kb


```
